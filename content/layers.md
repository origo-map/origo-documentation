## Source

Sources defined for the map are named under source. Each source is available for a layer by referencing its name.

#### Example defining sources

```json
{
  "source": {
    "local_wms": {
      "url": "http://localhost/geoserver/origo/wms"
    },
    "local_wmts": {
      "url": "http://localhost/geowebcache/service/wmts"
    }
  }
}
```

## Attributes

By default all available attributes for a queryable layer are listed in a featureinfo popup. The content can be customized in several ways, for example to make url:s or embed images. There are two basic approaches to do this. The first is to use a named handlebars template. This is what is used by default but requires a precompiled template. The second approach is to define how each attribute should be presented in the layer configuration. Each attribute is defined within curly brackets with options according the table below.

### Information window

Attribute options | Description
---|---
`name` | the name of the attribute. The value of the attribute will be shown. Optional.
`title` | static label for the attribute. Optional.
`url` | absolute url ('//example.com/nonsense.html') or attribute containing an url. Creates a link automatically and can be combined with name as value. Optional.
`urlPrefix` | a general prefix to be used together with url or img. Optional.
`urlSuffix` | a general suffix to be used together with url or img. Optional.
`target` | default behaviour is to open url in new window (_blank). It's possible to specify other targets as _top, _self and _parent or to open link in an iframe in a modal window which should than be set to modal for normal size or modal-full. Optional.
`targetTitle` | used along with target to define title in modal titlebar and link tooltip. Can be set to "static text" or "{{attribute value}}". Default is url.
`img` | attribute containing url to an image. The image will be embedded. Optional.
`splitter` | set a splitter for example , or ; which is used to split the attribute if it is made up of delimited list of compounded attributes of the same type. To be used together with `url`, `img` and `linktext`. Optional.
`cls` | css class name for custom styling. Optional.
`html` | custom html. Attributes can be referenced be placing the attribute name within double curly brackets.  It also possible in a similar way to insert functions, for example getCenter which is written as `{{@center}}`. Arguments can be added, for example `{{@center(EPSG:4326,reverse)}}` to get the center coordinates in EPSG:4326 with reversed coordinates (or `{{@center(EPSG:4326,default)}}` to maintain the axis orientation after transformation). The `html` option can't be combined with any of the other options, except for `cls`. Optional.
`linktext` | Name of attribute that holds the text that should be used on links when using `url` in combination with `splitter`. Optional.
`prefix` | adds the text entered in front of the attribute value. Optional.
`suffix` | adds the text entered after the attribute value. Optional.

#### Example defining layer attributes

```json
{
  "name": "mygeojson",
  "title": "My geojson with custom attributes",
  "source": "data/mylayer.geojson",
  "style": "mask",
  "type": "GEOJSON",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "name":"NAME",
      "title": "Name: ",
      "url": "PAGEID",
      "urlPrefix":"http://my.link.com/",
      "urlSuffix":".html"
    },
    {
      "html": "<p>For more information contact {{CONTACT}} at {{PHONE}}</p>",
      "cls": "o-custom-class-name"
    }
  ]
}
```

        }
 ]
```

## Attachments
While attributes are taken from each feature itself in a layer, an attachment is a file that
is stored somewhere else but can be treated as an attribute. An attachment is typically an
image or document that relates to a special feature and for practical reasons can not be stored in an attribute.
Attachments can be viewed, added and removed by the user in the editor form and viewed in featureInfo as links or emedded as images.

Attachments are configured on each layer. It can be configured
for both raster and vector layers, but can only be edited on vector layers.
In order to use attachments, an attachment server is needed. The attachment server must implement the arcgis server
rest api for attachments.

- _attachment Infos_ https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/attachment-infos-feature-service-.htm
- _attachment_ https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/attachment-feature-service-.htm
- _add attachment_ https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/add-attachment.htm
- _delete attachment_ https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/delete-attachments.htm


Optionally the server can extend the AGS interface by adding the concept
of attachment groups in order to group attachments in different groups. Groups can be used to have
different rules and display them differently. AGS server can be used out-of-the-box for AGS layers, but the extented
format must be implemented as a server side component.

The extensions to the AGS format are:

- The response from _attachments infos_ must include a "group" property for each attachmentInfo object
- The request to _addAttachment_ must include a "group" parameter

A reference implementation of the extended
format is available here: https://github.com/ornskoldsvikskommun/attachmentServer-reference It
should not be used for production environments as it lacks security, performance and
flexibilty.

### Attachment configuration
Attachments are configured on each layer using the `"attachments"` property containing an object with the following properties.

Property | Description | Required | Default value
---|---|---|---
`url` | The base adress for the attachment server. | Yes
`formTitle` | Title of section in editor form | No | 'Bilagor'
`format` | The format to use. 'origo' or 'arcgis'. 'origo' extenteds the AGS format by using groups | No | 'origo'
`foreignKey` | Name of the attribute in the parent feature that contains the private key. | No | Uses id of feature
`stripLayerNameFromId` | Removes layer name from featureid when _foreignKey_ is not specified. Useful when using geoserver wfs services to get only database FID as private key. | No | _true_
`layerId` | The layer id in the attachment server. | No | _Layer name_
`groups` | Array of [group objects](#Group-object) defining an attachment group. A group has its own title and each group is treated as a separate attribute. At least one group has to be specified. If format is "arcgis" exactly one group must be specified | Yes |


### Group object

Property | Description | Required | Default value
---|---|---|---
`name` | Name of the group on the attachment server. Ignored for format 'arcgis' | Yes |
`title` | Title displayed in the editor. Ignored for format 'arcgis' | No | `name`
`linkAttribute` | Name of an attribute to create on a feature containing all links as a semicolon separated list. Can be used to create links in featureInfo using the _img_ or _url_ property. | No |
`fileNameAttribute` | Name of an attribute to create on a feature containing all filename as a semicolon separated list. Order is same as linkAttribute list. Can be used in combination with _linkAttribute_ to set link text using the _linktext_ property | No
`allowedFiles` | Comma separated list of valid file extensions and mime types that are allowed to upload. Format is accordning to the accept attribute of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file | No | *

#### Example attachment configuration
```json
"attachments": {
        "formTitle" : "Attachments",
        "layerId": "entity_blob",
        "url": "http://gis.kommun.org/attachmentserver/",
        "groups": [
          {
            "name": "proto",
            "title": "Protocols",
            "allowedFiles": ".pdf"
          },
          {
            "name": "public",
            "title": "Public Image",
            "allowedFiles": ".jpg,.png",
            "linkAttribute": "pictureLinks",
            "fileNameAttribute": "pictureTexts"

          }
        ]
      }
```

#### Example display attachments in featureinfo configuration
```json
"attributes": [
    {
        "title": "Images",
        "linktext": "pictureTexts",
        "url": "pictureLinks",
        "splitter": ";"
     }
]
```

## Related Layers
A related layer is a layer that is a child in a _1-to-many_ relationship. Origo supports related layers for WFS layers by
defining a _private-foreign key relation_ between layers. The layers do not have to be in the same database or be servered from
the same WFS server. The relation is only stored in the child object, which makes it suitable for adding attributes
to a table that is considered read only.
A layer can have several child layers and a child layer can have child layers of its own.

Entries in the child layer can be added, deleted and edited through the parent's edit form and does not have a geometry of its own. Child objects may have a geometry,
but there is not support to edit or add new geometries other that edit the child layer directly.

Attributes from child layers can be aggregated and displayed in the featureInfo window of the parent.

### Related layers Configuration
All configuration regarding the relation is performed on the parent layer. The child layer must be configured as an ordinary wfs layer and most likely configured with
`'isTable': true`. The child layer can use `'strategy': 'bbox'` even if it is a table. In that case related objects are fetched when the parent is edited or featureInfo
is displayed

Relations are configured on the parent layer using the `"relatedLayers"` property containing an array of objects with the following properties.

Property | Description | Required | Default value
---|---|---|---
`layerName` | Name of the child layer as already configured as a layer | Yes |
`PK`| Name of the field that holds the private key in the parent object. | No | featureid (omit for featureid as that can not be explicitly set)
`stripPK` | If PK is featureid, remove layer name part from featureid when joining. Useful to keep only the fid part as FK in the database. | No | true
`FK` | Name of field in child that holds the foreign key. When a new entry is created this field will be updated with the value of PK of the parent. | Yes |
`FKIsString` | Has to be `true` if the FK field datatype in database is string. | No | false
`childTitle`| The title (string) that will be displayed above all child elements in the parent's attributes editor | No | Child layer's `title`
`featureTitle`| Name of the attribute that holds the text that will be displayed in the parent's attribute form for each feature | No | featureid
`maxChildren`| Number of children that can be added. | No | Unlimited
`cascadingDelete`| How to handle if parent is deleted. Can be one of `'cascade'` : delete recursively, both in database and in local layer. `'db'`: Assume database has cascading delete and only recursively delete locally. `'none'`:  Do nothing. Child remains both locally and in db, orphaned | No | `'none'`
`disableAdd` | `true` if the add button in the parent's edit form should be disabled for this layer| No | false
`disableDelete` | `true` if the delete button in the parent's edit form should be disabled for this layer | No | false
`disableEdit` | `true` if the edit button in the parent's edit form should be disabled for this layer | No | false
`promoteAttribs`| An array of [promoteAttrib objects](#promoteAttrib-object) that defines how attributes are aggregated and available to the parent in featureInfo | No | None


### promoteAttrib object

Each entry creates an attribute on the parent by first extract an expression from each child and then aggregate the
result from all children. Currently the only supported aggregation function is _string.join()_

Property | Description | Required | Default value
---|---|---|---
`parentName` | Name of the attribute to create in the parent | Yes |
`html` | Template string that extracts values from each child object. Attribute names enclosed in `{{}}` are replaced with its value. Does not have to be html, but can contain html tags | Yes
`separator` | String to use as separator when aggregating extracted strings | No | Empty string

#### Example related tables configuration
Basic example to set up a parent which has a related child layer. The parent itself is not editable, but the child layer has two attributes that can be edited. Also
the attributes from the child layer is aggregated and displayed in the featureInfo window of the parent.

```json
{
  "layers": [
    {
      // This is the child layer
      "name": "sf:person",
      "source": "local_wfs",
      "type": "WFS",
      "isTable": true,
      "attributes": [
        {
          "name": "name",
          "type": "text"
        },
        {
          "name": "org",
          "type": "text"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      // This is the parent layer
      "name": "sf:property",
      "queryable": true,
      "group": "root",
      "source": "local_wfs",
      "type": "WFS",
      "geometryName": "the_geom",
      "geometryType": "Point",
      "visible": true,
      "editable": true,
      "allowedEditOperations": [
        "updateAttributes"
      ],
      "attributes": [
        {
          "name": "adress",
          "type": "text",
          "readonly": true
        },
        {
          // This is the temporary attribute created by related table configuration
          "name": "responsible",
        }
      ],
      "relatedLayers": [
        {
          "layerName": "person",
          "FK": "parent_fid",
          "featureTitle": "name",
          "promoteAttribs": [
            {
              "parentName": "responsible",
              "html": "<p><b>{{name}},</b>{{org}}</p>"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
