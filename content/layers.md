## Source

The `source` option defines named sources that some layer types uses, typically service based sources. Most file based
sources only defines its source in the layer configuration.

Each source is defined as a json object with its
name as object name. This name is used by layers to reference the source.

The options that are available for a source depends on the type of layer and is described under each layer type.



#### Example defining sources

```json
{
  "source": {
    "local_wms": {
      "url": "http://localhost/geoserver/origo/wms"
    },
    "local_wmts": {
      "url": "http://localhost/geowebcache/service/wmts"
    }
  }
}
```

## Attributes

By default all available attributes for a queryable layer are listed in a featureinfo popup. The content can be customized in several ways, for example to make url:s or embed images. There are two basic approaches to do this. The first is to use a named handlebars template. This is what is used by default but requires a precompiled template. The second approach is to define how each attribute should be presented in the layer configuration. Each attribute is defined within curly brackets with options according the table below.

### Information window

Attribute options | Description
---|---
`name` | the name of the attribute. The value of the attribute will be shown. Optional.
`title` | static label for the attribute. Optional.
`url` | absolute url ('//example.com/nonsense.html') or attribute containing an url. Creates a link automatically and can be combined with name as value. Optional.
`urlPrefix` | a general prefix to be used together with url or img. Optional.
`urlSuffix` | a general suffix to be used together with url or img. Optional.
`target` | default behaviour is to open url in new window (_blank). It's possible to specify other targets as _top, _self and _parent or to open link in an iframe in a modal window which should than be set to modal for normal size or modal-full. Optional.
`targetTitle` | used along with target to define title in modal titlebar and link tooltip. Can be set to "static text" or "{{attribute value}}". Default is url.
`img` | attribute containing url to an image. The image will be embedded. Optional.
`carousel` | attribute containing url to several images combined with splitter option. Set `autoplay` in `featureinfoOptions` to have the carousel rotate the images. Optional.
`splitter` | set a splitter for example , or ; which is used to split the attribute if it is made up of delimited list of compounded attributes of the same type. To be used together with `url`, `img`, `carousel` and `linktext`. Optional.
`cls` | css class name for custom styling. Optional.
`html` | Custom html. Attributes can be referenced by placing the attribute name within double curly brackets.  It also possible in a similar way to apply a function by prepending the function name with `@`. See table below for supported functions. The `html` option can't be combined with any of the other options, except for `cls`. Optional.
`linktext` | Name of attribute that holds the text that should be used on links when using `url` in combination with `splitter`. Optional.
`prefix` | adds the text entered in front of the attribute value. Optional.
`suffix` | adds the text entered after the attribute value. Optional.
`formatDatetime` | makes it possible to format an attribute that contains a datetime value that follows ISO 8601 or Unix TimeStamp. FormatDatetime value should be a object specifying which locale to be used for the formatting and an options object with choosen formats, for example `{"locale": "sv-SE", "options": { "dateStyle": "full", "timeStyle": "long" }}` if you want swedish formatting with ful date and long time reprsentation or `{"locale": "en-US", "options": { "weekday": "long", "year": "numeric", "month": "long", "day": "numeric" }}` if you want american english, weekday and month as word and year and day as numbers. More formatting options can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat The default value is `{"locale": "default", "options": { dateStyle: 'full', timeStyle: 'long' }}`. Optional.

**Html Attribute Functions**

An html attribute function is either used with no arguments (all defaults) or all arguments specifed enclosed by parenthesis and separated by comma. Arguments are specified as constant values without any form of quotation marks.

Function name | Description | Arguments | Example
---|---|---|---
`@center` | Prints out the center coordinate of the geometry | coordinatesystem: _string_ (defaults to map coordsys), axis rotation: `default` \|\| `reverse` (defaults to `default`) | `{{@center(EPSG:4326,reverse)}}`
`@area` | Prints out the area of the geometry. Area is automatically scaled to a suitable unit (m2, ha, km2) | decimals: _integer_ (defaults to 2) | `{{@area}} {{@area(1)}}`
`@length` | Prints out the length of the geometry. Length is automatically scaled to a suitable unit (m,km) | decimals: _integer_ (defaults to 2) | `{{@length(1)}}`


#### Example defining layer attributes

```json
{
  "name": "mygeojson",
  "title": "My geojson with custom attributes",
  "source": "data/mylayer.geojson",
  "style": "mask",
  "type": "GEOJSON",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "name":"NAME",
      "title": "Name: ",
      "url": "PAGEID",
      "urlPrefix":"http://my.link.com/",
      "urlSuffix":".html"
    },
    {
      "html": "<p>For more information contact {{CONTACT}} at {{PHONE}}</p>",
      "cls": "o-custom-class-name"
    }
  ]
}
```


### Editor attributes

When editing a layer, additional attributes are supported to control the behaviour of the edit attributes tool.

Attribute option | Description

`allowBatchEdit` | _bool_ true if allowed to update a selection of features with the same value (optional)
`config`| _object_ Additional configuration. The config object depends on the _type_.
`constraint` | _string_  \<event\>:\<attribute name\>:\<value\> or \<event\>:\<attribute name\>:[\<value1\>,\<value2\>, ...], where \<event\> is the event that the \<attribute name\> input emits, most likely `change`. Attribute is only editable when \<attribute name\> has value \<value\> (optional)
`list` | _array of strings_ or _array of list object_. List of possible values for searchList. (optional)
`maxLength` | _int_ Maximum number of characters (optional)
`options` | _array of strings_ List of allowed values. Required for type `dropdown` (optional)
`readonly` | _bool_ True if attribute should be displayed but not allowed to edit (optional)
`required` | _bool_ True if the attribut must have a value (optional)
`defaultValue` | _string_ or _object_. When type is string that string is used as default value on feature creation. When it is an object a _defaultValue_ object defines behaviour (optional)


**Editor attribute types**

type | format | required | readonly | maxLength | constraint | Description
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
`text`      | string | supported | supported | supported || Text input
`textarea`  | string | supported | supported | supported || Text input with resizable box
`dropdown`  | string || supported || supported | Dropdown based on options values
`checkbox`  | boolean or configured values || supported ||| Checkbox, defaults to not checked.
`image`     | base64 || supported ||| Uploads image
`color`     | hexadecimal || supported ||| Activates a color-picker
`time`      | hh:mm:ss | supported | supported ||| Defaults to current time. Use defaultTime:false to not.
`date`      | YYYY-MM-DD | supported | supported ||| Defaults to current date. Use defaultDate:false to not.
`datetime`  | YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss | supported | supported ||| Defaults to current date. Use defaultDatetime:false to not.
`email`     | string | supported | supported ||| Email address
`url`       | string | supported | supported ||| Homepage address

`decimal`   | decimal | supported | supported ||| Decimal number
`searchList`   | string | supported ||supported. Defaults to 50|| Dropdown based on options values with search capabilities. 
`hidden` | string ||||| Not visible to the user.

**searchList List object**

Defines the possible values in a _searchList_

Property | Description | Required | Default value
---|---|---|---
`value` | _string_ text to display. If `useBackingValue` is set it is used as the value while `label` is used for display | When _location_ is not specified | 
`src`| _url_ to an image that will be displayed next to _value_. Url is relative to app or absolute | No |
`location`| _url_ to a HTML page that contains links to images. All a-tags hrefs that matches _extension_ will be used as list items. Filename will appear as text and the image itself as a thumbnail next to the text. If _location_ is specified it must be only item in list | No |
`extension` | Filename extension without dot to filter links when using _location_ | When _location_ is specified |
`label`| Text to display and search instead of value when `useBackingValue` is set | When `useBackingValue` is _true_ | 

**searchList Config object**
An object that defines additional configuration for searchList. The searchList can be configured to get its list from static configuration
or a remote server. If using a remote server it can either get all available options in one request or
query the server for each keypress. It can also be configured to use _value_ and _label_ similar to an HTML select drop down. In that
case _value_ is stored in the database but _label_ is displayed in the searchList.

__Requirerments on the backend server__
If the `url` option is used an additional HTTP server endpoint is needed, not included in the origo project.
The server must respond with a list of _searchList list objects_ as described above with the exception that `location` is not supported. There is no support for authentication other than what the browser
automatically provides, e.g. sending cookies or authentication headers if server is located on same site as application. 


If the `dynamic` option is used the server must accept a GET parameter named "input" or the configured `queryParameter` name. The parameter gets the value of the searchList text box and the server should return
a list of matching search items. The exact algorithm is up to the server, but origo will assume the list is filtered and sorted so the list will be displayed as is as suggestions, but will be truncated to `maxItems`. If the server's algorithm is not based on substrings of the value, the highlighting may not work as expected.

If the `useBackingValue` is specified in combination with `dynamic` the server must besides return both _value_ and _label_ for each list item also support reverse looking up in order to display correct label for the current value
when opening the attribute editor. The reverse lookup is performed by sending the current value as GET parameter "value". The surver must
then respond with a list with exactly one _searchList list objects_ with both _value_ and _label_ that corresponds to the current value.


Property | Description | Required | Default value
---|---|---|---
`url`| Url (GET) that responds with a JSON _array of List object_ (_location_ not supported) or _array of string_. If specified, _list_ property is ignored. | No  |
`dynamic` | _true_ if the server specified in `url` should be queried for each keypress. | No | false
`queryParameter` | Name of query parameter to use to send user input to `url` when `dynamic` is _true_| No | "input"
`allowOnlyFromList` | _true_ if the user only can input values from the list, which makes it work like a searchable drop down. | No | _false_
`disallowDropDown` | _true_ to allow the user to click the down arrow (or enter) when input is empty and get all possible suggestions even if minChar has not been reached. | No | _false_ 
`minChars` | Number of character that must be written before suggestions are displayed. | No | 2
`maxItems`| Number of suggestion items to display | No | 10
`typeMoreText` | The text to show to the user if the input has less then _minChar_ characters. | No | "Skriv fler tecken"
`noHitsText` | The text to show to the user if there are no suggestions to show. | No | "Inga träffar"
`useBackingValue` | If set to _true_ the list items must have both `value` and `label`. `value` is stored in the database and `label`is displayed in the searchList. If used in combination with `dynamic=true`, the server must also support reverse lookup as described in the requirements on the backend server. | No | _false_,
`valueQueryParameter`| When using `useBackingValue` in combination with `dynamic` the GET parameter name that is used for reverse lookup can be set using this parameter | No | "value"

**defaultValue object**
The defaultValue object controls how an attribute's default value is handled. Default values are always set when creating new features, and can optionally be set when updating attributes.
Default values can be overridden in the attribute editor unless attribute is configured as readonly or hidden.

Property | Description | Required | Default value
---|---|---|---
`type` | Source of default value. One of `sessionStorage`, `localStorage`, `timestamp`. If `timestamp` is specified it overrules default values for input types `time`, `date` and `datetime` | Yes | 
`key`| key in sessionStorage or localStorgage | When `type` is `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` |
`updateOnEdit`| `true` if default value should be applied when editing as well as creating a new feature. | No | `false`
`timeStampFormat`| One of `time` = "HH:mm:ss", `date`= "yyyy-MM-dd", `datetime` = "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss", `timestamp` = "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss | No | `timestamp`
`useUTC` | `true`if time should be in UTC, otherwise local time | No | `false`


**checkbox Config object**
An object that defines additional configuration for checkbox. The entire object is optional and all
properties are set to default if omitted.

Property | Description | Required | Default value
---|---|---|---
 `uncheckedValue` | Value that corresponds to the unchecked state | No | 0 (false)
 `checkedValue` | Value that corresponds to the checked state | No | 1 (true)

        }

## Attachments
While attributes are taken from each feature itself in a layer, an attachment is a file that
is stored somewhere else but can be treated as an attribute. An attachment is typically an
image or document that relates to a special feature and for practical reasons can not be stored in an attribute.
Attachments can be viewed, added and removed by the user in the editor form and viewed in featureInfo as links or emedded as images.

Attachments are configured on each layer. It can be configured
for both raster and vector layers, but can only be edited on vector layers.
In order to use attachments, an attachment server is needed. The attachment server must implement the arcgis server
rest api for attachments.

- _attachment Infos_ https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/attachment-infos-feature-service-.htm
- _attachment_ https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/attachment-feature-service-.htm
- _add attachment_ https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/add-attachment.htm
- _delete attachment_ https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/delete-attachments.htm


Optionally the server can extend the AGS interface by adding the concept
of attachment groups in order to group attachments in different groups. Groups can be used to have
different rules and display them differently. AGS server can be used out-of-the-box for AGS layers, but the extented
format must be implemented as a server side component.

The extensions to the AGS format are:

- The response from _attachments infos_ must include a "group" property for each attachmentInfo object
- The request to _addAttachment_ must include a "group" parameter

A reference implementation of the extended
format is available here: https://github.com/ornskoldsvikskommun/attachmentServer-reference It
should not be used for production environments as it lacks security, performance and
flexibilty.

### Attachment configuration
Attachments are configured on each layer using the `"attachments"` property containing an object with the following properties.

Property | Description | Required | Default value
---|---|---|---
`url` | The base adress for the attachment server. | Yes
`formTitle` | Title of section in editor form | No | 'Bilagor'
`format` | The format to use. 'origo' or 'arcgis'. 'origo' extenteds the AGS format by using groups | No | 'origo'
`foreignKey` | Name of the attribute in the parent feature that contains the private key. | No | Uses id of feature
`stripLayerNameFromId` | Removes layer name from featureid when _foreignKey_ is not specified. Useful when using geoserver wfs services to get only database FID as private key. | No | _true_
`layerId` | The layer id in the attachment server. | No | _Layer name_
`groups` | Array of [group objects](#Group-object) defining an attachment group. A group has its own title and each group is treated as a separate attribute. At least one group has to be specified. If format is "arcgis" exactly one group must be specified | Yes |


### Group object

Property | Description | Required | Default value
---|---|---|---
`name` | Name of the group on the attachment server. Ignored for format 'arcgis' | Yes |
`title` | Title displayed in the editor. Ignored for format 'arcgis' | No | `name`
`linkAttribute` | Name of an attribute to create on a feature containing all links as a semicolon separated list. Can be used to create links in featureInfo using the _img_ or _url_ property. | No |
`fileNameAttribute` | Name of an attribute to create on a feature containing all filename as a semicolon separated list. Order is same as linkAttribute list. Can be used in combination with _linkAttribute_ to set link text using the _linktext_ property | No
`allowedFiles` | Comma separated list of valid file extensions and mime types that are allowed to upload. Format is accordning to the accept attribute of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file | No | *

#### Example attachment configuration
```json
"attachments": {
        "formTitle" : "Attachments",
        "layerId": "entity_blob",
        "url": "http://gis.kommun.org/attachmentserver/",
        "groups": [
          {
            "name": "proto",
            "title": "Protocols",
            "allowedFiles": ".pdf"
          },
          {
            "name": "public",
            "title": "Public Image",
            "allowedFiles": ".jpg,.png",
            "linkAttribute": "pictureLinks",
            "fileNameAttribute": "pictureTexts"

          }
        ]
      }
```

#### Example display attachments in featureinfo configuration
```json
"attributes": [
    {
        "title": "Images",
        "linktext": "pictureTexts",
        "url": "pictureLinks",
        "splitter": ";"
     }
]
```

## Related Layers
A related layer is a layer that is a child in a _1-to-many_ relationship. Origo supports related layers for WFS layers by
defining a _private-foreign key relation_ between layers. The layers do not have to be in the same database or be servered from
the same WFS server. The relation is only stored in the child object, which makes it suitable for adding attributes
to a table that is considered read only.
A layer can have several child layers and a child layer can have child layers of its own.

Entries in the child layer can be added, deleted and edited through the parent's edit form and does not have a geometry of its own. Child objects may have a geometry,
but there is not support to edit or add new geometries other that edit the child layer directly.

Attributes from child layers can be aggregated and displayed in the featureInfo window of the parent.

### Related layers Configuration
All configuration regarding the relation is performed on the parent layer. The child layer must be configured as an ordinary wfs layer and most likely configured with
`'isTable': true`. The child layer can use `'strategy': 'bbox'` even if it is a table. In that case related objects are fetched when the parent is edited or featureInfo
is displayed

Relations are configured on the parent layer using the `"relatedLayers"` property containing an array of objects with the following properties.

Property | Description | Required | Default value
---|---|---|---
`layerName` | Name of the child layer as already configured as a layer | Yes |
`PK`| Name of the field that holds the private key in the parent object. | No | featureid (omit for featureid as that can not be explicitly set)
`stripPK` | If PK is featureid, remove layer name part from featureid when joining. Useful to keep only the fid part as FK in the database. | No | true
`FK` | Name of field in child that holds the foreign key. When a new entry is created this field will be updated with the value of PK of the parent. | Yes |
`FKIsString` | Has to be `true` if the FK field datatype in database is string. | No | false
`childTitle`| The title (string) that will be displayed above all child elements in the parent's attributes editor | No | Child layer's `title`
`featureTitle`| Name of the attribute that holds the text that will be displayed in the parent's attribute form for each feature | No | featureid
`maxChildren`| Number of children that can be added. | No | Unlimited
`cascadingDelete`| How to handle if parent is deleted. Can be one of `'cascade'` : delete recursively, both in database and in local layer. `'db'`: Assume database has cascading delete and only recursively delete locally. `'none'`:  Do nothing. Child remains both locally and in db, orphaned | No | `'none'`
`disableAdd` | `true` if the add button in the parent's edit form should be disabled for this layer| No | false
`disableDelete` | `true` if the delete button in the parent's edit form should be disabled for this layer | No | false
`disableEdit` | `true` if the edit button in the parent's edit form should be disabled for this layer | No | false
`promoteAttribs`| An array of [promoteAttrib objects](#promoteAttrib-object) that defines how attributes are aggregated and available to the parent in featureInfo | No | None


### promoteAttrib object

Each entry creates an attribute on the parent by first extract an expression from each child and then aggregate the
result from all children. Currently the only supported aggregation function is _string.join()_

Property | Description | Required | Default value
---|---|---|---
`parentName` | Name of the attribute to create in the parent | Yes |
`html` | Template string that extracts values from each child object. Attribute names enclosed in `{{}}` are replaced with its value. Does not have to be html, but can contain html tags | Yes
`separator` | String to use as separator when aggregating extracted strings | No | Empty string

#### Example related tables configuration
Basic example to set up a parent which has a related child layer. The parent itself is not editable, but the child layer has two attributes that can be edited. Also
the attributes from the child layer is aggregated and displayed in the featureInfo window of the parent.

```json
{
  "layers": [
    {
      // This is the child layer
      "name": "sf:person",
      "source": "local_wfs",
      "type": "WFS",
      "isTable": true,
      "attributes": [
        {
          "name": "name",
          "type": "text"
        },
        {
          "name": "org",
          "type": "text"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      // This is the parent layer
      "name": "sf:property",
      "queryable": true,
      "group": "root",
      "source": "local_wfs",
      "type": "WFS",
      "geometryName": "the_geom",
      "geometryType": "Point",
      "visible": true,
      "editable": true,
      "allowedEditOperations": [
        "updateAttributes"
      ],
      "attributes": [
        {
          "name": "adress",
          "type": "text",
          "readonly": true
        },
        {
          // This is the temporary attribute created by related table configuration
          "name": "responsible",
        }
      ],
      "relatedLayers": [
        {
          "layerName": "person",
          "FK": "parent_fid",
          "featureTitle": "name",
          "promoteAttribs": [
            {
              "parentName": "responsible",
              "html": "<p><b>{{name}},</b>{{org}}</p>"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
## Automatic default (legend) style for WMS layers
A WMS layer can have a style property defined for its legend graphic or for an alternate layer style defined on the WMS server. If a style property is not defined then Origo will attempt to create one for the legend graphic using getLegendGraphic and optionally two additional layer properties can then be defined, `legendParams` and `hasThemeLegend`.  

`hasThemeLegend` is used to manually indicate if the layer has theme symbology and that the legend should be behind a theme style icon (extendedLegend).

Example `legendParams` object with Geoserver vendor parameter
```json
      "legendParams" : {
        "scale" : 5000,
        "legend_options" : "dpi:300"
      }
```
## stylePicker
The stylePicker is available for vector layers and WMS layers. It is defined in one way for vector layers and a slightly different way for WMS layers due to the different nature of styles of image type layers like WMS layers compared to the client side styles of vector layers.
#### vector layers
A stylePicker refers to defined styles and allows a style title to be set. (It usually makes sens for the `style` property of the layer to refer to one of the styles in the stylePicker.)
```json
"stylePicker": [
  {"title": "Sommarstil", "style": "bokbuss_sommar"},
  {"title": "Sval ton", "style": "bokbuss_bla"}
]
///
"styles": {
  "bokbuss_sommar": [
    [
      {
        "stroke": {
          "color": "rgba(211,84,0,1.0)"
        },
        "fill": {
          "color": "rgba(241,196,15,0.9)"
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```
#### WMS layers
if a stylePicker is defined for a WMS layer then it refers to styles available to the layer on the WMS server. 

A `style` layer property is overriden and any `hasThemeLegend` and `legendParams` are incorporated in the stylePicker on a per layer basis (rather than as properties of the layer). 

There can only be one `defaultWMSServerStyle` as well as `initialStyle` where the later specifies which style the map should load with. If there's no `initialStyle` specified then the first style in the array will be it.
```json
      "stylePicker": [
        { "title": "Ljus", "style": "Bakgrund_bke_fk_lj_0484" },
        { "title": "Mörk", "style": "Bakgrund_bkm_fk_mo_0484",
          "initialStyle": true,
          "hasThemeLegend": true,
            "legendParams": {
              "legend_options": "dpi:600"
            }
        },
        { "title": "Standard", "defaultWMSServerStyle": true, 
          "legendParams": {
            "scale": 100
          } 
        }
      ]
```
## text/html infoFormat for WMS-layers
WMS servers can usually serve getFeatureInfo requests with a text/html reply. Sometimes they provide customizability of these replies. Then the html returned can have an infinite amount of variation. Origo has basic support for Geoserver WMS layers configured with `infoFormat: text/html`:

 if the layer also has the `htmlSeparator` property set to an html tag, like `htmlSeparator: 'ul'` Origo will try to separate the features from the html reply via the configured tag and present the infoclick hits with a selection that can be traversed via clicking the features in the infowindow or cycling the carousel of the overlay like usual. If no such tag is present for a layer a point will show where the infoclick happened and all feature hits will be presented in one overlay/infowindow (representing the reply from the WMS server as it is). 

 Because of :milky_way: amount of variation of featureInfo html responses Origo may not be able to separate features with a supplied tag, to this end it is possible to supply Origo with a handler function for the featureInfo html reply. This can be done via the api: `origo.api().getFeatureinfo().addTextHtmlHandler(function)` as well as via a plugin that would define a function and `viewer.getFeatureinfo().addTextHtmlHandler(function)`. 
 
 It is advisable to check the default function in src/getfeatureinfo.js to see the form of what is to be returned depending on whether a `htmlSeparator` prop is provided.

 Note that the `source` of the [WMS](#wms) layer must have the `type` prop with the `geoserver` value for the `text/html` value of the `infoFormat` property to have the proper effect.
